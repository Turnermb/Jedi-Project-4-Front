# Overwatch Hub

## Collaborators: Matthew Turner

One of my recent obsessions is Overwatch and honestly, I'm not that good. Which is why I found myself getting frustrated at how difficult it was to find replays from higher level players that I could watch in the in game replay feature rather than through a twitch or youtube channel. This is how Overwatch Hub was born.

## Tech

For the technologies I used, the main two were react for the front end, and rails for the back end. Milligram was used to give basic styling to the page as well.

## Wishlist for the future

- Communities: In the future I hope to add a feature where content creators can create communities allowing them to easily pull replays for VOD reviews specifically targetted at them by their audience.

- Auth: Goes along with communities in that it would allow people to create accounts to asociate with them.

- Responsiveness: I'm still trying to figure this out.

## Conclusion

Thank you for taking the time to look at my project, I hope you have a good one.
