# Overwatch Hub

## Collaborators: Matthew Turner

One of my recent obsessions is Overwatch and honestly, I'm not that good. Which is why I found myself getting frustrated at how difficult it was to find replays from higher level players that I could watch in the in game replay feature rather than through a twitch or youtube channel. This is how Overwatch Hub was born. This is the second incarnation with the first being made in React and Rails, while this one keeps React for the frontend but swaps to Python and Django for the backend.

I think my biggest downfall with this project was spending quite a bit of time doing things that weren't necessarily integral to getting everything done. I spent a bit of time on a logo that I didn't actually wind up using and spent a day and a half messing with Azure after deployment struggles.

## Tech

For the technologies I used, the main two were React for the frontend, and Python with Django for the backend. Milligram was used to give basic styling to the page as well.

Python was completely new to me at the beginning of this project and I still don't feel I really have a handle on it. Several of you may have heard me cursing both the language and myself for taking it on in TA hours. But the backend works, and I think that says more to me just being way too good at this than anything else.

## Wishlist for the future

- CRUD: The biggest one is finishing out the edit and delete features. I had a lot of issues figuring out where the data from my database was being stored.

- Archive: Since replays are wiped after each patch, I'd like to add an archival function that takes the date as a variable and searches and archives everything before the specified date.

- Communities: In the future I hope to add a feature where content creators can create communities allowing them to easily pull replays for VOD reviews specifically targeted at them by their audience.

- Auth: Goes along with communities in that it would allow people to create accounts to asociate with them. As well as makes your replays easy to find for editing.

- Responsiveness: I'm still trying to figure this out.

## Conclusion

Thank you for taking the time to look at my project, I hope you have a good one.
